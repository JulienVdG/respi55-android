#How to use Respi 5/5

The exercise (and the application) is very simple: you just need to respect the rhythm!

1) Press “Start” to begin the session.<br />
2) Figures 1-5 are displayed at the same time as the circle grows: inhale, preferably through the nose.<br />
3) From 1 to 5, when the circle shrinks: exhale through the mouth (as if you mentally expel all your stress).<br />
4) Finally, press “Stop” to complete the exercise.<br />


####Important information
**Duration**: 5 minutes minimum at 5 seconds of inspiration and expiration 5 per cycle (= is 5 seconds to 5 seconds to inhale and exhale).

**Frequency**: To be truly effective, the exercise should be done for at least 5 minutes 3 times a day (or more of course as soon as you have the time and inclination).

#### In addition, to help you

For the duration of the exercise, try to respect abdominal breathing. (Your belly swells when you take air and deflates when you breathe. Do not hesitate to put one hand on your stomach to help you).

Every 5 minutes, 1 small circle will appear at the top left of the screen. A new will be added to the previous to represent the next 5 minutes elapsed.

You can start with one long breath: one deep and slow breath followed by one deep and slow exhalation. The latter completed; press “Start” with the next inspiration.

Initially, the exercise may seem tricky and you may have preferred a rate of 4 to 6 seconds, but do not fear, a few cycles are sufficient to seamlessly adapt.
